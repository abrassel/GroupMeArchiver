The purpose of the GroupMeArchiver is to pull complete records from any GroupMe chat that you are a member of.  It saves likes, time stamps, messages, and pictures.

Additionally, all images and chat logs are indexed by time of creation and filed appropriately.

We understand that sometimes privacy and space are often concerns when you're creating a local copy of potentially personal conversations, so we offer the ability to compress and encrypt your files.  To get started, install the requests and pyAesCrypto library and then launch ./cmdprompt.py.  Make sure that you have Python3 on your path.
